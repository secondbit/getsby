## Diagnosis

Depression and ADHD -- good ol&rsquo; Depression :) with the added &ldquo;joy&rdquo; of it having an environmental aspect.  

## Medication

I  was originally put on Strattera for ADHD but it smoothed *everything* out: mood swings, attitude, sex life and even creativity - so much so that I found it hard to do my job properly because I just lost that edge.  After being on it for almost two years I stopped taking it and now have learned how to manage myself.

Depression I learned how to manage without drugs.

## Challenges

Focus and mood swings. A lot of folks depend on me and when I&rsquo;m in the middle of an &ldquo;attack&rdquo; it becomes hard to be the person. My wife has learned how to adjust to the different phases of my depression and helps me through it all.

## Strategies

Walks, lots of sun light and learning how to know when I&rsquo;m at the start of a down turn so I can shorten the dip. You cannot ever stop having episodes, but you can learn how to mitigate the impact and work thru them. I also have informed anyone who will listen what it looks like when I&rsquo;m having an episode so they can make sure I don&rsquo;t go completely silent.
