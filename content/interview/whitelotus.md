## Diagnosis

I have an anxiety disorder. When I was very little I experienced anxiety related some some things but for the most part of my life I didn&rsquo;t have any issues until a few years ago. I believe relationship issues caused me to have several panic attacks, but it went undiagnosed for over a year and was just written off as random issues with my stomach. A year after that relationship ended I had a major panic attack that lasted all night, and due to the severity of it and the lack of understanding as to what was happening I felt like I was dying. All night long I was wondering I had been poisoned or if I was having a heart attack or something worse. There were many points where I could hardly breathe. I walked myself to the emergency room and waited from four to five hours to see a doctor, only to have them tell me it was probably just an anxiety disorder.

## Medication

I was originally prescribed propranolol as needed, but that didn&rsquo;t do anything for me. They then gave me klonopin as needed which almost always works very well. It is nice because I don&rsquo;t need to take anything regularly, but it still affects me because I don&rsquo;t drink anymore. I was told alcohol can cause panic attacks for people with anxiety, and if I were to have a couple beers or something then if I did have a panic attack I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to take my medication because it shouldn&rsquo;t be taken with alcohol, so I prefer to just not drink anymore. It often makes people wonder why I don&rsquo;t have a drink, and I suspect several of them think I am boring because I don&rsquo;t want to go out to bars or even have a beer with them. My close friends understand though.

## Challenges

The biggest things it affects for me are dating and work. The night I had the big panic attack and walked myself to the emergency room I had texted the girl I was dating at the time what I was going through and she didn&rsquo;t respond. The next day she texted me that she didn&rsquo;t want to have to deal with these issues so we shouldn&rsquo;t see each other anymore. I went on several dates with other girls later that year and anxiety caused problems with most of them. A lot of people don&rsquo;t know what it is like, and even if they do know what it is like and are accepting of it they would still prefer someone who doesn&rsquo;t have any issues.

## Strategies

From what I have read about anxiety, many of the relaxation techniques involve something to distract yourself from what you&rsquo;re going through. I find that I do the opposite and that seemed to help a great deal in the long term. I think the anxiety I have is a result of some aspect of my psyche that is illogical, so if I find what that is and focus on that then I can slowly work my way into it and untie whatever knots I find. Over the last year I have had two strong panic attacks, but aside from those I have noticed a strong decline in the overall levels of anxiety I feel. Today I almost forget what anxiety feels like, but there are good days and bad. The bad ones lately aren&rsquo;t so terrible anymore though.
