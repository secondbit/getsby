## Diagnosis

6 months ago I was diagnosed with Generalised Anxiety Disorder and mild depression. I still struggle to understand that diagnosis because I don&rsquo;t have any kind of negative thoughts or downs&mdash;I simply have days where nothing feels quite normal and I want it to be bed time so that I don&rsquo;t have to think any more.

## Medication

I take Loxalate (escitalopram&mdash;a common SSRI), Zopiclone for sleep and Metaclopramide for nausea. I have very mixed feelings about escitalopram. I was warned that it would likely make my symptoms worse before they got better, and my god did it do that! For weeks I felt like I had to think about my breathing at all times and that if I stopped thinking about it, I&rsquo;d stop breathing. I was always either short of breath or hyperventilating. I got an intolerably itchy rash on my back that I couldn&rsquo;t stop scratching, and I spent several days lying on the floor in my kids room with no motivation to get up. I would set up Lego on their bedroom floor so that I could pretend I was lying there to play with them. After a while the symptoms stabilised and now I don&rsquo;t have any serious side affects, other than a somewhat reduced sex drive.

## Challenges

The biggest challenge for me has been coming to terms with the fact that I have a mental health disorder. Not because of the stigma, or because I&rsquo;m ashamed&hellip; simply because I never thought it would happen to me. I have always had a very positive outlook on life. I grew up feeling grateful that I have no family history of mental health issues. A decade ago I was diagnosed with a form of epilepsy and at the time I was relieved that if something had to be wrong with my brain, it was seizures that affected my physicality, rather than something that affected my mental health, because as a suicide counsellor I had witnessed first hand how incredibly hard that battle can be. I think it was for that reason that it took me such a long time to admit to myself (let alone anyone else) that something else was going on.

How does this affect my daily life? I go into battle with my own consciousness every single day. When I drive home from the gym first thing in the morning I run a check with myself. How am I feeling today? Am I feeling normal? Am I looking forward to my day? If the answer is yes, then I have a normal (no, a great) day. If the answer isn&rsquo;t yes, then I go into recovery mode. &ldquo;You know this always happens and that it will ok. You know that this is your head playing tricks on you. You know that the pills will help.&rdquo; And then I get frustrated because life shouldn&rsquo;t be a struggle. Every day should be a new adventure, not 12 hours to get through until I can go to sleep.

> &ldquo;I go into battle with my own consciousness every single day.&rdquo;

And then there is the sleep battle. For the year prior to my diagnosis I was lucky to get a couple of hours sleep per night. I don&rsquo;t even know what was keeping me awake. I wasn&rsquo;t actively worrying about things. But if something woke me up, it was a given that I wasn&rsquo;t going back to sleep. The Zopiclone helps with that but I try not to take it any more because the epilepsy meds give my liver a hard time and it doesn&rsquo;t need to be put under the excess pressure that other drugs will cause.

My anxiety feels like a physical thing. When I have a bad day I can&rsquo;t sit still. I can&rsquo;t relax normally or just do nothing. If I have finished my work for the day and the house is clean and the kids are playing happily, I don&rsquo;t know what to do with myself. I try to interrupt them so that I am needed. My mind races and I just want to lie down on the floor in a warm place and do nothing, but doing nothing is impossible. I feel alone because even talking about it doesn&rsquo;t help. I feel stuck inside my own head with no way to make things normal again.

## Strategies

I don&rsquo;t know that I have any successful strategies. I felt like I tried everything before I realised that this was bigger than me and sought medication. I make sure that I exercise hard every day, I eat carbs to stimulate serotonin production, I rationalise with myself, I remind myself of all the things in my life that are good, I talk openly and honestly about what is going on in my head, and if none of that works, I just go through the motions until the day is over and I can go to bed. My doctor says that this is likely short term thing that will pass. I am holding on to that because more than anything in the world, I don&rsquo;t want this to happen to my children.
