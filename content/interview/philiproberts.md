## Diagnosis

I have been diagnosed by my doctor as having &ldquo;moderate depression&rdquo;. My therapist and I think that I also suffer from anxiety problems that exacerbate the depression.

My depression manifests as periods of crippling &ldquo;lows&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ll find myself feeling very upset or frustrated, and not wanting to face anything. On the worst days it feels like I have a noisy swarm of angry wasps in my brain that hate me and won&rsquo;t leave me alone.

> &ldquo;It feels like I have a noisy swarm of angry wasps in my brain that hate me and won&rsquo;t leave me alone.&rdquo;

These periods can last for a few minutes or a few days, and tend to come in waves corresponding to stress levels or other external factors.

Looking back, I feel that I have suffered from many symptoms and behaviours related to depression for a long time, but it is only in the last few years that life has become &ldquo;hard&rdquo; enough.

## Medication

For the last 5 or 6 months I have been taking Citalopram, which is an [SSRI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor) that is frequently used to treat depression. I have been lucky in that it is the first drug I tried and seems to be working, so I haven&rsquo;t had to try multiple medications.

It&rsquo;s hard for me to understand how significantly the meds have helped my depression, but I am certainly glad that I&rsquo;ve been taking them. Placebo or otherwise, taking them gives me a lot more time and space in my head to handle depressive episodes as well as anxiety. There are a few areas (sex-drive in particular) where I think the meds have a slightly negative effect on my life. At the moment these downsides are still hugely outweighed by the benefits, but I think as I get better at handling the depression, I&rsquo;ll get to the point where I&rsquo;d like to come off the medication.

To me it doesn&rsquo;t feel like a cure though. It feels like a tool that has helped reset my brain chemistry to the point that I can start to tackle the underlying causes of my depression with therapy.

## Challenges

Believing that I even have a &ldquo;problem&rdquo; has taken a long time, and a lot of energy, to get used to. I am not ashamed of having a mental health illness, but I have spent a lot of time wondering if I am &ldquo;making it all up&rdquo; to use as an excuse or a crutch, and that maybe I am taking something away from people who need &ldquo;real help&rdquo; by seeking help. This hindered me going to the doctor, seeing a therapist, and talking about it with my family and my wife. I think I have now found a better point of view, which is that if I think it&rsquo;s affecting my life&mdash;or the people around me&mdash;then there is an issue.

My depression sometimes stops me from being the best person that I can be, and that is very frustrating. It doesn&rsquo;t help that I almost certainly set standards for myself which are too high, but the depression, anxiety, and feeling like a failure or impostor are a vicious cycle of emotions that can leave me paralysed to such an extent that I can&rsquo;t do my best&mdash;or indeed any&mdash;work.

> &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do my best&mdash;or indeed any&mdash;work.&rdquo;

In the past I have often found it hard to disentangle my depression from other feelings, which means it&rsquo;s been relatively easy for a depressive episode to be triggered. A hard day at work, even if it&rsquo;s been really productive, might mean I haven&rsquo;t eaten as well as I should and I get a bit of a headache&mdash;which feels physically very similar to being in the depths of a slump, and can be enough to trigger one.

## Strategies

Counselling, specifically CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy), has without a doubt been the most significant step in handling my depression. I have strongly negative beliefs about who I am, and I enlist very poor strategies to help me cope with my perceived deficiencies. I strongly believe that these feelings and behaviours are a significant cause of my depression. CBT has been amazing in helping me understand what I believe about myself, and to look at the strategies I am employing and spot where they are failing me.

 I was initially pretty scared about getting a &ldquo;therapist&rdquo; and thought they would expose me as some kind of &ldquo;fraud&rdquo; inventing my depression for attention. I can now see how flawed that thinking was, and strongly feel that almost anybody, depressed or not would benefit significantly from talking to a counsellor. There is almost nothing in my life that hasn&rsquo;t been improved as a result of my weekly counselling sessions.

I am also getting better at managing my energy levels&mdash;both in terms of making sure I am getting enough exercise throughout the week, as I find that really helps, as well as just making sure I am eating enough of the right things to keep my blood sugar levels stable, as peaks and slumps in my blood sugar can definitely trigger a low mood if I am not careful.

I have also been very open about sharing my experiences of depression and my treatment with other people in my community. This was a bit of a risky decision initially as I wasn&rsquo;t sure that being so open would necessarily help my depression, but I am so glad I have done it now. It&rsquo;s been really helpful for me to feel like something positive has come out of my illness, whether it&rsquo;s seeing people discussing mental health more in my community, or hearing that someone else was able to seek treatment after my account of what I have been through helped to ease their fears.

I still feel like I have a long way to go with managing my depression better though. I don&rsquo;t know that it will ever go away completely, but I&rsquo;m confident that with the right strategies I will be able to manage it pretty well.
