## Medication

I take Citalopram for the depression, and very occasionally prescription sleeping aids to help with the poor sleep I suffer from as a symptom of depression. The Citalopram&rsquo;s main job is to stop me feeling too down and/or suicidal, and seems to work pretty well. Thankfully the side-effects are minimal.

## Challenges

The biggest issue I have with the depression is the lack of motivation to do anything. It&rsquo;s a colossal struggle professionally to function when all my brain is wanting to do is vegetate and be unproductive. It&rsquo;s quite a vicious circle with the unproductivity&mdash;being unproductive makes me feel bad and down, and that spurs even less productivity. With the Asperger&rsquo;s, the most obvious thing that occurs is accidentally offending people; but the significant literal thinking and the ability to concentrate fully on my field is very handy.

## Strategies

My main strategy to help with both of the above is to work with others. I&rsquo;m very poor at planning, so having someone else to help with my weak areas whilst I concentrate on my strong-points is very useful.
